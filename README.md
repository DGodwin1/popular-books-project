I like books. ðŸ“šðŸ¤“

Sometimes I'm told 'you should read this author' but I don't know where to start. ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜¬

Thought I'd use that as a starting point to make an app that, after entering an author, tells you a popular book. ðŸ¤—

Allowed me to play with the Goodreads API â€” particularly API keys, requests with parameters, parsing XML â€” and working on my first basic Flask application. ðŸ’»

Next steps? Getting it hosted! ðŸš€
